    <td>Leaders from Oneida Baptist Institute in conjunction with Magoffin Baptist Institute worshipped with Mash Fork Missionary Baptist Church. Distance and Weather difficulties for these leaders brought the need for a Baptist church in Salyersville to the attention of many people. A revival was held in Salyersville with Rev. W.H. Sledge as evangelist and Bro. Ruth as song-leader. Forty people were received of which thirty-seven were received by baptism. W.H. Sledge helped to organize the Salyersville Missionary Baptist Church, and Rev. George Bush was elected as the first pastor. It was said to have begun as a mission of the Mash Fork Missionary Baptist Church.</td>

        <i>Below are excerpts from the Baptist Faith and Message 2000, which serves as our statement of faith.
</i><br/><strong>The Scriptures</strong> <br/>
The Holy Bible was written by men divinely inspired and is God's revelation of Himself to man. All
Scripture is totally true and trustworthy. <br/>
<strong> God </strong> <br/>
There is one and only one living and true God. God is all powerful and all knowing. The eternal triune
God reveals Himself to us as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, with distinct personal attributes, but without
division of nature, essence, or being. <br/>
<strong>Man </strong> <br/>
Man is the special creation of God, made in His own image. He created them male and female as the
crowning work of His creation. The gift of gender is thus part of the goodness of God's creation. By his
free choice man sinned against God and brought sin into the human race. Only the grace of God can
bring man into His holy fellowship and enable man to fulfill the creative purpose of God. The sacredness
of human personality is evident in that God created man in His own image, and in that Christ died for
man; therefore, every person of every race possesses full dignity and is worthy of respect and Christian
love. <br/>
<strong>Salvation </strong> <br/>
Salvation involves the redemption of the whole man, and is offered freely to all who accept Jesus Christ
as Lord and Savior, who by His own blood obtained eternal redemption for the believer. There is no
salvation apart from personal faith in Jesus Christ as Lord. <br/>
<strong>God’s Purpose of Grace </strong> <br/>
All true believers endure to the end. Those whom God has accepted in Christ, and sanctified by His
Spirit, will never fall away from the state of grace, but shall persevere to the end. Believers may fall into
sin through neglect and temptation, whereby they grieve the Spirit, impair their graces and comforts,
and bring reproach on the cause of Christ and temporal judgments on themselves; yet they shall be kept
by the power of God through faith unto salvation.<br/>
<strong>Evangelism and Missions </strong> <br/>
It is the duty and privilege of every follower of Christ and of every church of the Lord Jesus Christ to
endeavor to make disciples of all nations. The new birth of man's spirit by God's Holy Spirit means the
birth of love for others. <br/>
 <strong>Stewardship </strong> <br/>
God is the source of all blessings, temporal and spiritual; all that we have and are we owe to Him.
<br/> <strong>Cooperation </strong> <br/>
Christ's people should, as occasion requires, organize such associations and conventions as may best
secure cooperation for the great objects of the Kingdom of God. Such organizations have no authority
over one another or over the churches.
Christian unity in the New Testament sense is spiritual harmony and voluntary cooperation for common
ends by various groups of Christ's people. Cooperation is desirable between the various Christian
denominations, when the end to be attained is itself justified, and when such cooperation involves no
violation of conscience or compromise of loyalty to Christ and His Word as revealed in the New
Testament. <br/>
<strong>The Christian and the Social Order </strong> <br/>
In the spirit of Christ, Christians should oppose racism, every form of greed, selfishness, and vice, and all
forms of sexual immorality, including adultery, homosexuality, and pornography. We should work to
provide for the orphaned, the needy, the abused, the aged, the helpless, and the sick. We should speak
on behalf of the unborn and contend for the sanctity of all human life from conception to natural death.
<br/> <strong>Religious Liberty </strong> <br/>
God alone is Lord of the conscience, and He has left it free from the doctrines and commandments of
men which are contrary to His Word or not contained in it. Church and state should be separate. A free
church in a free state is the Christian ideal, and this implies the right of free and unhindered access to
God on the part of all men, and the right to form and propagate opinions in the sphere of religion
without interference by the civil power.
Below are excerpts from the Baptist Faith and Message 2000, which serves as our statement of faith.
 <br/> <strong>The Family </strong> <br/>
God has ordained the family as the foundational institution of human society. It is composed of persons
related to one another by marriage, blood, or adoption. Marriage is the uniting of one man and one
woman in covenant commitment for a lifetime. The husband and wife are of equal worth before God,
since both are created in God's image. The marriage relationship models the way God relates to His
people. Children, from the moment of conception, are a blessing and heritage from the Lord.
